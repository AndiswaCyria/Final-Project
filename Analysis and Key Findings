## Comparative Analysis Summary 

# Total COVID-19 Cases Over Time

South Africa recorded the highest total number of cases consistently across the period, peaking at over 3 million cases by 01 - 16 - 2022.

India and Russia had sharp increases at different stages, especially visible during their respective waves (e.g., Delta surge in India in February 2022).

Kenya, Nigeria, and Morocco showed much lower overall case counts compared to larger countries like South Africa and India, reflecting either lower transmission or under-reporting.

# Total-19 Deaths Over Time
Again, South Africa reported the highest cumulative deaths in Africa, but India and Russia led globally in absolute numbers by the end of the period.

Nigeria and Kenya kept death counts relatively low, though this may partly reflect differences in testing/reporting.

# Daily New Cases
The plot showed clear waves of infections:
- South Africa’s sharp spikes aligned with the Beta and Omicron waves.
- India experienced a significant surge in mid-2021 (Delta wave).
Morocco and Egypt showed steadier patterns, with smaller peaks.

# COVID-19 Death Rate (Total Deaths/Total Cases)
Egypt displayed a consistently high death rate early on, likely due to testing limitations.

South Africa’s death rate was lower than Egypt’s but rose during peak waves.

India’s death rate remained relatively moderate, despite high case numbers.

# Vaccination Progress 
India and China scaled vaccination programs massively, surpassing hundreds of millions of doses.

In Africa:
- Morocco was a standout performer, achieving over 62.8% of its population fully vaccinated.
- South Africa also made strong progress but lagged Morocco slightly.
- Nigeria and Kenya showed slower progress, with vaccination percentages remaining low well into 2022.

# People Fully Vaccinated (% of Population)
The choropleth map made it clear that North African countries (e.g., Morocco, Egypt) outpaced Sub-Saharan Africa in vaccine coverage.

Russia and China had high full vaccination rates, crossing significant thresholds by 06 February 2023.

## Key Insights: 
Vaccination inequities are stark: some African countries lagged far behind global leaders.

Death rate analysis may reflect both health system capacity and data/reporting gaps.

Waves of infections followed global trends but were timed differently across regions, likely due to variant spread.
